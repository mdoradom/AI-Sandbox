# Exercise 3

## Objective

>In this lab, you will create a Unity scene that replicates the Zombie Scene from slide 11 of the "World Interfacing & Knowledge" section. The goal is to implement zombies using AI principles and techniques that handle perception, communication, and interaction. You will also enhance the scene with clean coding practices and optimizations.

## Scene Setup

Your scene should include a group of AI zombies 🧟‍♂️🧟‍♀️ that exhibit the following behaviors:

- **Zombie Prefab 🧟‍♂️:** All zombies must be instantiated from a single, reusable prefab. This prefab will handle both visual elements and behavior to ensure consistency.

- **Zombie Perception (Camera Frustum) 👁️:** Use the camera frustum to simulate zombie perception. Zombies should detect when they enter the player's view and react accordingly (e.g., begin chasing the player or change behavior).

- **Zombie Communication 📡:** Utilize Unity’s BroadcastMessage method to allow zombies to communicate with one another. For instance, if one zombie detects the player, it should broadcast a message to nearby zombies, triggering them to act as well.

## Deliverables:

- **Unity Package 📦:** Submit the full Unity project, including the scene, scripts, and any assets you used.

- **Video 📹:** Record a video showcasing the Zombie Scene. Make sure to:
    - Explain how the zombie prefab was implemented.
    - Demonstrate the zombies' use of the camera frustum for perception 👁️.
    - Highlight how zombies communicate with each other using BroadcastMessage 📡.
    - Showcase any additional creative elements or optimizations in your scene.
