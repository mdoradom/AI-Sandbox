# Exercise 4

## Objective

>In this lab, you will simulate the robber behavior observed in Slide 12 of the "Decision Making" section using Finite State Machines (FSMs). This exercise is designed to deepen understanding of FSMs and how decision-making structures are applied in AI for character behaviors.

## Scene Setup

You can choose between two methods to complete the lab, each focusing on implementing the robberâ€™s behavior in Unity:

1. **Delegate-Based FSM (Slide 12)**

    Utilize delegate-based FSMs, focusing on modular state transitions and maximizing code reusability.

2. **Unity Animation FSM (Slide 14)**

    Implement the FSM using Unityâ€™s animation system to visually represent state transitions between different behaviors.

## Deliverables:

1. **UnityPackage ðŸ“¦**

Export the project as a UnityPackage, ensuring all FSM scripts, animations (if used), and necessary assets are included.

2. **Video Demonstration ðŸ“¹**

Record a video demonstrating the FSM in action. The video should clearly:

- Show the robber's transitions between states.

- Demonstrate how each state responds to conditions in the scene.
 
## The Exercise

In this exercise, we refractored the previous exercise to wrap all the logic of the zombie detection and player movement to be controller via a FSM.

### Controls
