# Exercise 2

## Objective

> In this lab, you will create a Unity scene that simulates flocking behavior using boids. The aim is to program AI agents to move in groups, demonstrating flocking dynamics with steering behaviors. You will also enhance the scene with visual creativity and optimized movement, and adhere to clean coding best practices.

## Scene Setup

Your scene should include a group of AI agents (boids) that demonstrate the following:

- **Flocking Behavior:** Implement the classic flocking behavior where agents move in groups following three main rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion.

    - **Separation:** Boids should steer to avoid crowding local flockmates.

    - **Alignment:** Boids should steer towards the average heading of their neighbors.

    - **Cohesion:** Boids should steer to move toward the average position of nearby flockmates.

    - **Leader Boid ðŸ¦…:** Add an extra "leader" boid to the flock. This leader should have a distinct behavior (e.g., attracting the group or guiding them in a specific direction). Your group should follow this leader while still maintaining flocking principles.

## Deliverables:

- **Unity Package ðŸ“¦:** Submit the complete Unity project, including the scene, scripts, and any assets used.

- **Video ðŸ“¹:** Record a video showcasing the flocking behavior. Make sure to:
    - Explain the flocking rules you implemented (separation, alignment, cohesion).
    - Highlight how the "leader" boid interacts with the group.
    - Demonstrate scene creativity and optimized boid steering.
