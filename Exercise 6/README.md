# Model Hyperparameter Testing and Evaluation

In this document, we outline the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of a neural network model by testing different hyperparameters. The goal is to assess how varying the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size affects the model's accuracy and loss.

## 1. Hyperparameters Tested

The following hyperparameters were tested in our experiments:

### Learning Rate
- **Description**: The learning rate determines the size of the steps the optimizer takes during training. A small learning rate might slow down the training, while a large learning rate could result in overshooting the optimal solution.
- **Values tested**: `0.1`, `0.01`, `0.001`

### Epochs
- **Description**: The number of epochs indicates how many times the model will go through the entire training dataset.
- **Values tested**: `10`, `20`, `50`

### Batch Size
- **Description**: The batch size controls how many samples are processed before updating the model weights.
- **Values tested**: `32`, `64`, `128`

## 2. Experiment Setup

For each combination of these hyperparameters, the model was trained and evaluated. The following metrics were recorded for each experiment:

- **Training accuracy** and **validation accuracy**
- **Training loss** and **validation loss**

Each experiment was repeated to ensure robustness and to avoid overfitting or random fluctuations in performance. 

## 3. Results Overview

The results of the experiments are summarized in the following sections. For each combination of hyperparameters, the following visualizations were generated:

1. **Training and Validation Loss/Accuracy Graph**: A plot showing the training and validation loss/accuracy over epochs.
2. **Predictions Grid**: A grid of images showing the predicted labels versus the true labels for a subset of test images.
