# Exercise 7

## Objective

> In this lab, you will create a new learning environment using Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit. This task involves designing and training an intelligent roller ball agent capable of completing tasks in a defined environment. The lab introduces concepts in reinforcement learning applied to a custom-built Unity environment.

## Setup and Instructions

To complete this lab, follow these steps:

**1. Environment Creation**

- Follow the tutorial [Making a New Learning Environment](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md) provided by Unity ML-Agents.

**2. Brehavior Implementation**

- Watch the example video: https://github.com/EjbejaranosAI/AI4VJ/blob/main/Labs/4_Deep_Learning_labs/RollerBall.mp4

- Use the ML-Agents Toolkit to implement the desired behavior for the Roller Ball agent.

**3. Training the Agent**

- Train the Roller Ball agent using Unity ML-Agents, adjusting parameters like learning rate, buffer size, and max steps as necessary to achieve optimal behavior.

- Save and document your training results.

## Deliverables:

- **Project Folder ðŸ“‚:** Include the entire Unity project folder with all necessary files to replicate your work.

- **Video ðŸ“¹:** Record and submit an unedited video showcasing the Roller Ball agent's behavior in the environment.

- **Submission Method:** Use either Google Drive or GitHub to submit your deliverables. Ensure all files are organized and easily accessible.
